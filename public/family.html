  <div>
  <p>Let me start by saying this. I AM BLESSED to have a family</br>
     like mine. I realise that it's not common for people to </br>
     have "broken" homes, but for a time, mine was. It was only</br>
     through a miracle and 11 years that my family all lived</br>
     under 1 roof. However, even when things were tough, both</br>
     of my amazing parents still cared for me as much as they</br>
     possibly could.
    </p>
   </br>
   </br>
    <p>
    On top of my immediate family being supportive, even though</br>
    distance, I had some pretty baller cousins. Without them, I </br>
    wouldn't be as put together as I am today. In fact, one of them</br>
    actually convinced and encouraged me to take this coding path.</br>
    Who are they? take a look below.
