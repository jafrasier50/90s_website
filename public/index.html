      <h3>Who am I?</h3>
      <p>To start, I'm a 24 year old student at DigitalCrafts Coding Bootcamp in</br>
        Houston, Texas. I'm orginally from Tallahassee, Florida, so getting used</br>
        to the big city(let alone the 4th Largest in the nation) has been... overwhelming.</br>
        I've been all over the place in regaurd to what I want to do with my life;</br>
        however, I feel that doing Front-End engineering seems to be the direction</br>
        I want to commit to pursuing. So, Let's give it a shot and build something!
