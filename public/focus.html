      <p>I know that when I mentioned that I was "all over the place" in</br>
         terms of what I wanted wanted to do with my life. If I'm being </br>
         honest, I still don't know if this is it, but I'm commited to seeing</br>
         it through. It really helps that I like this. Maybe this is what I'm</br>
         cut out for.

      <h3>So, what IS my focus?</h3>
    </div>
      <p>My focus is to leave an impression. Not the just any, but the biggest</br>
         I'm capable of. Whether it was serving that last table at 9:58pm on a</br>
         Friday night, Waking up before the crack of down to open the store for</br>
         breakfast, or having a sleepless night catching up and going through</br>
         at Headquarters, I want to leave an impression that someone will say </br>
         something about.</br>
       </br>
         Part of that focus is building relations with all those around me.</br>
         I believe it is relations that take someones oppertunities to the </br>
         next level.</br>
